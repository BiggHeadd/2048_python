# 2048_python
just a tiny code for spending my spare time

now it can init the 4*4 matix with 1 and 2
and it can do the slide up down right left by using the 'w' 's' 'd' 'a' on the keyboard

the game on the fold 2048 use UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT control to play.
the problem is that: when i slide to any direction, whether it can slide or not, it will show up new bricks, and the ending of the game is not so good.
